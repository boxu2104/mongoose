# Development and Runtime Environment

## Pip, Virtualenv, and VirtualenvWrapper

We used [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/) to manage the dependencies for our language. One useful strategy was to keep an up-to-date `requirements.txt` file that contained all the dependencies. To install the latest dependencies, a simple `pip install -r requirements.txt` was needed.

[Virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/) provides distinct python "virtual environments" that allow a clean separation between the OS-default python installation/binaries, and the project-specific python installation/binaries. Virtualenv and pip work together to provide a clean development environment that we could then commit to our hosted Git repository ([Github](https://github.com/)) for distribution among team members.

## Git and Github
Git (and Github, our hosted repository) were instrumental in succeeding in this project...
