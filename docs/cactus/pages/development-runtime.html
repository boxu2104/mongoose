# Development and Runtime Environment

## Pip, Virtualenv, and VirtualenvWrapper

We used [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/) to manage the dependencies for our language. One useful strategy was to keep an up-to-date `requirements.txt` file that contained all the dependencies. To install the latest dependencies, a simple `pip install -r requirements.txt` was needed.

[Virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/) provides distinct python "virtual environments" that allow a clean separation between the OS-default python installation/binaries, and the project-specific python installation/binaries. Virtualenv and pip work together to provide a clean development environment that we could then commit to our hosted Git repository ([Github](https://github.com/)) for distribution among team members.

## Git and Github
The distributed version control system Git (and Github, our hosted repository) were instrumental in this project. Git allows developers to work independently on one or more branches within a given repository, and makes merging commits and branches as painless as possible.

We strived to make our commits as granular as possible, and to write meaningful commit messages. This style of committing code facilitates *communication* about the code among the developers, and clearly communicates the *intention* of code updates.
