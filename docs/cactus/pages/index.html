### Release Notes:
#### May 12, 2013:
0. We ran into last-minute errors disambiguating list access from variable declarations. As a short-term hack, we've modified variable declarations (the variable declaration must be preceded by a tilde, e.g. `~int x` is currently a valid declaration in Mongoose). This will be corrected in the next release.
1. We have not yet completely implemented the functionality of agents (specifically, agents with a destroy block) â€” the destroy block currently does nothing. This will be implemented in future version of Mongoose.
