#Language Tutorial

Introduction
============

Our aim here is to efficiently get the programmer familiar with writing
Mongoose programs. This section contains a few short programs that are
intended to familiarize the reader with a good amount of Mongoose’s core
features. This includes built-in function, for statements, probability
features, and the execution order. Our intention here is specifically
not to elaborate in full detail every aspect of the Mongoose language.
The reference manual is more exhaustive than this section on the
specifics of Mongoose’s core language features as well as its advanced
features. This tutorial aims to quickly get the reader’s hands dirty at
the expense of not showcasing advanced Mongoose features. Patience will
be rewarded in many cases as details of certain concepts will be
elaborated further in the tutorial after they had been briefly
introduced early in the tutorial.

As soon as the reader has satisfactorily digested this tutorial, she can
progress to building more advanced programs using the knowledge from
this section as a basis.

Since a language is mastered by practice, please take some time after
each section to modify the programs and test them until they break to
see the uses and limits of Mongoose.

1. First Program and Running Mongoose
=====================================

Before we start executing a mongoose program, we will look at the code
for the “hello, world” program in Mongoose. This is a standard first
program for learning any programming language.

This program prints “hello, world”:

environment^[[a]](#cmnt1)^{

none populate(){

print("hello, world\\n")

}

none action(){

}

}

terminate{}^[[b]](#cmnt2)^

analysis{}

The code for this program is placed in a file whose name ends with .mon.
To then run this program you must have the python interpreter 2.7, PLY
3.4, and the mongoose Python module. If the above program was called
hello.mon, the command would be:

python mongoose.py hello.mon

The output will be:

hello, world

Now, we will discuss the syntax of the above program. Every Mongoose
program contains functions, variables and blocks. The functions and
variables in Mongoose programs work in similar ways as those of C and
Java. Variable contain values that may be altered during the execution
of a program. Functions are code units that can be called with
arguments. Blocks as they are used in Mongoose are unique to Mongoose
and for now can be thought of as code units without the argument
usability that functions have. Blocks will be discussed further below
and in the reference manual.

Our example has a function named populate(). Mongoose allows user
defined function names, but populate is one of the function names that
must be used. The populate() function is a special function. Every
Mongoose program must have the populate() function inside the
environment block. The code contained in this function may have
statements, including those that call other user-defined functions or
Mongoose library functions.

In this example, the parentheses after the word populate are empty.
Mongoose does not allow command line arguments so populate does not
accept arguments, but other Mongoose required functions that will be
introduced later do have the option to have zero or more arguments. This
brings us to the built in print function. As opposed to the use of
populate here which defines a function, here print is a function that is
called. Since it is built in, the user does not have to write its
definition. The argument used for print is the string “hello, world”.
Thus we tell the print function to print to standard output the
characters that are included in the passed string.

Here is a modified program with comments (not to be included in actual
program):

environment{ \#start of environment block

populate(){ \#start of populate function definition

print("hello, world\\n") \#call print on "hello, world\\n"

print("how ") \#call print on "how "

print("are ") \#call print on "are "

print("you?") \#call print on "you?"

}

none action(){

} \#end of populate func definition

} \#end of environment block

terminate^[[c]](#cmnt3)^{} \#to be discussed later

analysis{}

2. Declarations, Variables and Statements
=========================================

We will now write a program that simulates Conway’s Game of Life. It is
a zero player game, whose evolution is determined solely by its initial
configuration and set of rules. We will build up the program
step-by-step; therefore, the early code snippets will not be fully
functional Game of Life simulations. The successive phases will include
more code than previous phases and may include alterations to lines of
an earlier phase. Thus progress will mainly be made in language
knowledge and program functionality rather than specific sequences of
statements.

Our program will build off the work done in the previous section. The
populate function will contain that initialization code for the game’s
initial configuration. We will be introducing comments, variables,
declaration, assignment and objects.

\# This program is phase 1 of 3 of building Game of Life simulation

agent Cell{

int i

int j

Cell create(int r, int c) {

self.i = r

self.j = c

}

none destroy() {

}

none action() {

}

}

environment {

Cell[1] my\_Cells

none populate() {

env.my\_Cells[0] = Cell(4,4)

}

none action() {

}

}

terminate{}

analysis{}

The first line of this program that starts with a hash symbol is a comment. Any string of characters that is prepended by an un-escaped hash symbol is ignored by Mongoose’s translator. Its sole purpose is for human readability - not machine interpretation.
================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Like C and Java, variables in Mongoose must be declared. A variable is sequence of strings that represents a location in memory. Mongoose enforces that variables be declared to be of a certain type. The programmer must define what type a variable is. In this example, the variables i and j are declared to be of type int. Types of variables also include float, bool and string. Further down, my\_Cells is declared to be of type Cell[1]. In addition to this being a type declaration it is also a list creation. Cell[1] sets aside space for a list, where each element in the list is of type Cell and the length of the list is currently 1.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

Before we get to objects, let us understand what assignment is. An assignment statement is a special kind of statement that either initializes a variable or modifies a variable to hold a different value. The word self is used when an agent is accessing or mutating its own instance variables. Here the agent is setting its i and j values. self is effectively a reference to oneself. The statements:
==============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

self.i = r

self.j = c

are assignment statements. Since the variables i and j have not previously been explicitly set by the programmer, these assignment statements are, more specifically, initialization statements. Note that individual statements are terminated by newlines.
============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

The line:
=========

my\_Cells[0] = Cell(4,4)

is an assignment statement. my\_Cells is being assigned to an agent
instance of type Cell. By instantiation we mean that the function call
Cell() is not a regular function. Like a regular function it can include
passed arguments and it has a return type. However the return type is
that of an agent object and the return value is an agent object
reference. This reference contains the state of the object as well as
its methods. Thus after this assignment my\_Cells will hold an object
reference to an agent. This agent’s values are i and j and its methods
are its constructor and destroy() and action().

You may have noticed that the function definitions for destroy and action are left empty. Although they are empty, they are required by Mongoose and end up being useful for fully functional simulations.
==========================================================================================================================================================================================================

3. Expressions, For Statement
=============================

We will now continue to build up our Game of Life simulation by adding
critical helper functions. These functions will be defined here but not
called until the final program in the next phase.

\#This program is Phase 2 of 3 of building Game of Life Simulation

int avg(int[] elements) {

int sum = 0

for (int i in elements) {

sum = sum + i

}

return sum/elements.length

}

int countAlive(){

int num\_alive = 0

for(int i in range(0, env.board.length)){

for(int j in range(0, env.board[0].length)){

if(board[i][j].alive){

num\_alive = num\_alive + 1

}

}

}

return num\_alive

}

int neibLiveCnt(int row, int col){

int count = 0

board\_height = env.board.length

board\_width = env.board[0].length

if(row-1\>=0 and env.board[row-1][col].alive){

count = count + 1

}

if(row+1<=board\_height-1 and env.board[row+1][col].alive){

count = count + 1

}

if(col-1\>=0 and env.board[row][col-1].alive){

count = count + 1

}

if(col+1<=board\_width-1 and env.board[row][col+1].alive){

count = count + 1

}

return count;

}

agent Cell{

int i

int j

bool alive

Cell create(int r, int c) {

self.i = r

self.j = c

}

none destroy() {

}

none action() {

}

}

environment {

Cell[5][5] board

none populate() {

for(int i in range(0, env.board.length)){

for(int j in range(0, env.board[0].length)){

env.board[i][j] = Cell(i,j)

}

}

}

none action() {

}

}

terminate{}

analysis{}

We will start with

if(env.board[i][j].alive){

num\_alive = num\_alive + 1

}

An if statement is a conditional statement. Only if the expression
within the parentheses evaluates to true the code between the curly
braces that immediately succeeds these parentheses is executed. In this
example, if the alive field of the Cell object located at board[i][j]
equals true, then the statement

num\_alive = num\_alive + 1

is executed. This bring us to the arithmetic expression on the right
hand side of this assignment assignment. In our previous assignment
example, the right hand side was a list. Here our right hand side
evaluates by means of an arithmetic expression to a single int value.
The right hand side evaluates to an integer that is one plus the integer
value held in num\_alive. Therefore this assignment statement is in
effect incrementing num\_alive ’s value by one. The same is true of the
line

return sum/elements.length

where the return value is being set to the arithmetic evaluation of the
right side’s division expression.

Based on our current understanding we can see that the neibliveCnt()
counts and returns the number of neighboring cells in the agent board
that are alive, where a neighbor is defined as the cell directly above,
below, left and right of that cell. The avg() and countAlive() functions
are still unclear based on our current understanding due to their use of
the for statement.

To discuss the for statement, we start inside the avg() function:

for (int i in elements) {

sum = sum + i

}

The goal of the avg function is to go find the average of all integer
values that are passed in as the elements list. This requires looking at
each element in this list. Mongoose provides a for statement that allows
iteration syntax similar to that of Python. It is not the same since we
require type declaration of iteration variable. Before the first
iteration the variable i set to the value in the first index in the
elements list. After every iteration of this loop the variable i is set
to the next element in the list. Thereby, setting sum to be the total
value of all integers in this list after the loop.

The segment:

for(int i in range(0, env.board.length)){

for(int j in range(0, env.board[0].length)){

if(env.board[i][j].alive){

num\_alive = num\_alive + 1

}

}

}

adds two new concepts to our for loop basic understanding. Firstly, we
see the use of the range() function. As we saw in our previous example,
the structure of a for loop is:

for(<type\> variable in list){ }

Thus, in our example above, the range() function simply returns a list.
This list contains consecutive integer values that start with the value
of the first argument and end with a value of one less than the second
argument. Therefore the list size is the positive difference of the two
arguments.

The second new for loop use here is that of the compound for loop. This
simply means that just as the sum was increased each loop in the
previous example, another inner loop is executed for each of the outer
iterations in this example. Thus, if the size of range(0, board.length)
is x and the size of range(0, board[0].length) is y, then
if(board[i][j].alive){...} will be executed x\*y times. Thus, the
countAlive() function goes through every cell in the board and counts
how many are alive.

We must discuss the use of the keyword env. It is an analogue for self
except that the env keyword prepends accesses to the environment’s
variables. In this case the board is an instance variable of the
environment.

4. Execution Path, TICKCOUNT, Lists, Probability Statement
==========================================================

Before we get into the code for the final build of the simulation, let’s
discuss more about our specific implementation of the simulation. For
our initial configuration, we put Cell objects into each cell of the
board. Each cell will have a position defined by its row and columns
values. Additionally, each agent has an alive value; when this is false
the cell is dead, and alive when true. At each transition, the cell
becomes dead or alive or doesn’t change based on how many of its
neighbors are alive.

}

\#nothing happens, just stays alive

}

if(self.alive and neibLiveCnt(i, j)\>3){

self.alive = false

}

if(self.alive==false and neibLiveCnt(i, j)==3){

self.alive = true

}

}

}

environment {

Cell[5][5] board

int[] alive

none populate() {

for(int i in range(0, env.board.length)){

for(int j in range(0, env.board[0].length)){

env.board[i][j] = Cell(i,j)

}

}

}

none action() {

env.alive.append^[[d]](#cmnt4)^( countAlive(env.board) )

}

}

terminate {

1:(TICKCOUNT == 5000) ^[[e]](#cmnt5)^^[[f]](#cmnt6)^

}

analysis {

print(avg(env.alive))

}

There are four blocks in a Mongoose program: agent, environment,
terminate and analysis.

This is the first time we will see the terminate and analysis blocks in
use. As we discuss the execution timeline, it will become clear as to
the purpose of these four blocks and how they relate to each other. When
a Mongoose program is run, the environment’s instance variables are
initialized with a call to its populate method. Here that includes
initializing and then filling the board with cell objects. Then a loop
occurs. This loop starts with the calling of every agent’s action method
succeeded by the environment calling its action method. This loop
terminates if any of the termination conditions in the terminate block
evaluates to true. In this case, there is only one termination
condition: TICKCOUNT == 5000. We will discuss more on TICKCOUNT shortly.
Finally, after the loop, the code in the analysis block is called. This
is where a user can call functions that show something about the
simulation that occurred in the loop. In this case, this includes
printing the average number of alive cells throughout the simulation.

TICKCOUNT is a special variable that is a key feature of Mongoose due to
Mongoose’s focus on discrete event simulations. Firstly, TICKCOUNT is
global in that any code fragment in any section of a Mongoose program
can access TICKCOUNT’s value. TICKCOUNT’s value cannot be modified by
the programmer. Secondly, TICKCOUNT is never declared or initialized.
Lastly, TICKCOUNT acts as a counter to the number of loops that have
been executed in the <agents’ action - environment’s action\> loop; it
is incremented at the end of each iteration by Mongoose, not the
programmer. Thus, in this program, the expression 1:(TICKCOUNT == 5000)
means that when the loop has gone through 5000 iterations, it
terminates. Unlike this case, in some cases the expression to the right
of the colon can be computationally intensive and the user may not want
to check that specific termination condition at the end of each loop.
Therefore, the number that precedes the colon determines the frequency
with which it is called. In our case the number is 1 so it is called at
the end of every loop. If this number was 5, the expression would be
evaluated at the end of every fifth loop. If no number is included the
default used is 1. So our implementation is semantically equivalent to

(TICKCOUNT == 5000)^[[g]](#cmnt7)^

Let us now discuss more about lists. Specifically our use of the alive
list has two interesting aspects.

int[] alive

...

...

env.alive.append^[[h]](#cmnt8)^( countAlive(board) )

On the first line above - the declaration line, Mongoose acts
differently than Java. Lists in Mongoose are dynamic (i.e. they can be
arbitrarily resized at runtime), so initializing them is optional. On
the second line, we see that the list has an append function. In this
case, the function adds the return value of the countAlive() function to
the end of the alive list.

Before we complete our discussion, let us turn our attention to the line

env.alive = (1: true | 1: false)^[[i]](#cmnt9)^

When the environment is populating the board and establishing the
initial configuration, this line ensures some randomness of which pieces
are alive and which are dead. Essentially this is just like any other
assignment statement except that the right side’s evaluation to true or
false is of a syntax that is unique from that of other languages. The
regular expression for this general form is:

( (<weight\>:<value\> | )\* <weight\>:<value\> | <weight\>:<value\> )

This construct is critical to Mongoose’s focus on baking clear and
concise probability control flow into simulations. The weights here act
as a probability distribution. That is, if one value has weight x and
another value has weight 2\*x, the latter has twice the probability of
being assigned to the variable on the left of the assignment statement.
The weights are thus normalized. All weights must be non-negative
integer values. The values must be of the same type as the type that the
value is assigned to. The entire expression evaluates to one of the
values with the probability associated with that value. In our case each
cell’s alive value has equal chance of being true or false.

5. Anonymous Functions and more Probability Control Flow
========================================================

In this section we will write a program in the Schelling segregation
model, which models over time the movement of different people who are
said to be part of different groups. In our case we choose gender. Over
time a researcher may want to see if certain people cluster near people
who share similar characteristics. In our case, we move different people
to a different location if they are surrounded by a certain number of
people with opposite gender. Our analysis includes checking how many
people are surrounded by 75% of their same gender, thus illustrating a
clustering level. Our environment creates the people and randomly puts
them in different slots.

int row = p.row

int col = p.col

print(“simulation ended because of convergence.”)

}

}

analysis{

\#gets number of cells that have 75% of neighbors with equal gender

print(getSurroundCount(.75))

}

In the terminate block we see the use of a function without a declared
name. This is called an anonymous function. It is used most often for
quick and concise code segmentation and more specifically, when the code
within that function is not useful anywhere else.

In the environment block, we see a construct of the form

pif( probability ) { stmt\* } pelif( probability ) { stmt\* } pelse {
stmt\* }

Due to Mongoose’s focus on coding simulations, its creators included
this construct to make probability baked into control flow. This
construct is a probability inspired modification on Python’s if, elif,
and else construct with one major difference: Mongoose has probabilities
in the parentheses whereas Python has boolean expressions. In our
example, this means that with probability .3, the code in the curly
braces right after pif will execute. With probability .6, the code in
the code in the curly braces right after pelif will execute. And
finally, with .1 (=1-.6-.3) probability the line right after pelse will
execute. If the pif expression contains a value greater than one, an
error will occur. If the if expression is followed by pelif ’s that and
their combined sum exceeds one, an error will occur. If a pelse is used
the probability with which it is executed is the sum of its preceding
zero or more pelif’s and one pif subtracted from one as we saw in our
Schelling example above.
