#Language Tutorial

Introduction
============

Our aim here is to efficiently get the programmer familiar with writing
Mongoose programs. This section contains a few short programs that are
intended to familiarize the reader with a good amount of Mongoose’s core
features. This includes built-in function, for statements, probability
features, and the execution order. Our intention here is specifically
not to elaborate in full detail every aspect of the Mongoose language.
The reference manual is more exhaustive than this section on the
specifics of Mongoose’s core language features as well as its advanced
features. This tutorial aims to quickly get the reader’s hands dirty at
the expense of not showcasing advanced Mongoose features. Patience will
be rewarded in many cases as details of certain concepts will be
elaborated further in the tutorial after they had been briefly
introduced early in the tutorial.

As soon as the reader has satisfactorily digested this tutorial, she can
progress to building more advanced programs using the knowledge from
this section as a basis.

Since a language is mastered by practice, please take some time after
each section to modify the programs and test them until they break to
see the uses and limits of Mongoose.

1. First Program and Running Mongoose
=====================================

Before we start executing a mongoose program, we will look at the code
for the “hello, world” program in Mongoose. This is a standard first
program for learning any programming language.

This program prints “hello, world”:

<pre><code>
	environment{
        populate{
             print("hello, world")
        }
        action{
        }
}

terminate{
        (true){}
}
analysis{
}

</code></pre>

The code for this program is placed in a file whose name ends with .mon.
To then run this program you must have the python interpreter 2.7, PLY
3.4, and the mongoose Python module. If the above program was called
hello.mon, the command would be:

<pre><code>./mongoose hello.mon</code></pre>

The output will be:

<pre><code>hello, world</code></pre>

Now, we will discuss the syntax of the above program. Every Mongoose
program contains functions, variables and blocks. The functions and
variables in Mongoose programs work in similar ways as those of C and
Java. Variable contain values that may be altered during the execution
of a program. Functions are code units that can be called with
arguments. Blocks as they are used in Mongoose are unique to Mongoose
and for now can be thought of as code units without the argument
usability that functions have. Blocks will be discussed further below
and in the reference manual.

Our example has a block named populate. Populate is one of the blocks names that
must be used. Every Mongoose program must have the populate block inside the
environment block. The code contained in this function may have
statements, including those that call other user-defined functions or
Mongoose library functions.

Blocks have no arguments in Mongoose. This brings us to the built in print function. 
Since it is built in, the user does not have to write its
definition. The argument used for print is the string “hello, world”.
Thus we tell the print function to print to standard output the
characters that are included in the passed string.

Here is a modified program with comments (not to be included in actual
program):
<pre><code>
environment{
        populate{
                print("hello, world") #call print on "hello, world"
                print("how ") #call print on "how "
                print("are ") #call print on "are "
                print("you?") #call print on "you?"
        }
        action{
        }
}

terminate{
        (true){}
}
analysis{
}
</code></pre>

2. Declarations, Variables and Statements
=========================================

We will now write a program that simulates The Game of Pig. It is
a 2 player game, whose evolution is determined solely by its initial
configuration and set of rules. Players role dice to accumulate a certain score.
On any player's turn, he may keep on rolling dice until he wishes to halt. However,
if a player rolls a 1, they lose all their points.
We will build up the program step-by-step; therefore, the early code snippets will not be fully
functional Pig simulations. The successive phases will include
more code than previous phases and may include alterations to lines of
an earlier phase. Thus progress will mainly be made in language
knowledge and program functionality rather than specific sequences of
statements.

Our program will build off the work done in the previous section. The
populate function will contain that initialization code for the game’s
initial configuration. We will be introducing comments, variables,
declaration, assignment and objects.
<pre><code>
# Game of Pig
agent A {
      ~int x = 0
      ~int count = 0
      create(){
          print("On create A")
      }
      action {
      }
      destroy {

      }
}


environment {
    ~int apoints = 0
    ~int bpoints = 0
    ~int win = 10
    populate {
        ~A a = A()
    }

    action {
    }
}

terminate {
    (true) {
    }
}

analysis {
}
</code></pre>
The first line of this program that starts with a hash symbol is a comment. Any string of characters that is prepended by an un-escaped hash symbol is ignored by Mongoose’s translator. Its sole purpose is for human readability - not machine interpretation.

Like C and Java, variables in Mongoose must be declared. A variable is sequence of strings that represents a location in memory. Mongoose enforces that variables be declared to be of a certain type. The programmer must define what type a variable is. In this example, the variables x and count are declared to be of type int. Types of variables also include float, bool and string. Further down, `a` is declared to be of type A. 

Before we get to objects, let us understand what assignment is. An assignment statement is a special kind of statement that either initializes a variable or modifies a variable to hold a different value. Here the agent is setting its x and count values.

Since the variables x and count have not previously been explicitly set by the programmer, these assignment statements are, more specifically, initialization statements. Note that individual statements are terminated by newlines.

The line:
<pre><code>
~A a = A()
</code></pre>
is an assignment statement. `a` is being assigned to an agent
instance of type A. By instantiation we mean that the function call
A() is not a regular function. Like a regular function it can include
passed arguments and it has a return type. However the return type is
that of an agent object and the return value is an agent object
reference. This reference contains the state of the object as well as
its methods. Thus after this assignment `a` will hold an object
reference to an agent. This agent’s values are x and count and its methods
are its constructor, destructor and action block.
You may have noticed that the blocks for destroy and action are left empty. Although they are empty, they are required by Mongoose and end up being useful for fully functional simulations.

3. Expressions, Repeat Statement
=============================
We will now continue to build up our Game of Life simulation by adding
critical helper functions. These functions will be defined here but not
called until the final program in the next phase.
<pre><code>
agent A {
      ~int x = 0
      ~int count = 0
      create(){
          print("On create A")
      }
      action {
        x = roll()
        if((x>=1) and (x <=1)){
            print("lose")
            count = 0
        }
        count = count + x
      }
      destroy {

      }
      none print_hi() {
          print('hi')
          return
      }
      none print_num(~int x) {
          print(x)
          return
      }
      int roll() {
          ~int sdg = ( 2:1 | 4:2 | 6:3 | 10:4 )
          print("die roll")
          print(sdg)
          return sdg
      }
    int getCount(){
    return count 
  }
}

agent B {
      ~int x = 0
      ~int count = 0
      create(){
          print("On create A")
      }
      action {
        repeat(5){
          x = roll()
          if(x>=1 and x <=1){
              print("lose")
              count = 0
          }
          count = count + x
        }
      }
      destroy {

      }
      none print_hi() {
          print('hi')
          return
      }
      none print_num(~int x) {
          print(x)
          return
      }
      int roll() {
          ~int sdg = ( 2:1 | 4:2 | 3:3 | 2:4 )
          return sdg
      }
}


environment {
    ~int apoints = 0
    ~int bpoints = 0
    ~int win = 10
    populate {
        ~A a = A()
        ~B b = B()
    }

    action {
        print("a.x:", a.count)
        print("b.n:", b.count )
        apoints = a.count
        bpoints = b.count
    }
}

terminate {
    (true) {
        
    }
}

analysis {
}
</code></pre>

We will start with
<pre><code>
if(x>=1 and x <=1){
     print("lose")
     count = 0
}
</code></pre>
An if statement is a conditional statement. Only if the expression
within the parentheses evaluates to true the code between the curly
braces that immediately succeeds these parentheses is executed. In this
example, if x is 1, then the statements

<code>
 print("lose")
 count = 0
</code>

are executed. This brings us to the arithmetic expression on the right
hand side of `count = count + x`. Here our right hand side
evaluates by means of an arithmetic expression to a single int value.


To discuss the repeat statement, we look at:
<pre><code>
repeat(5){
          x = roll()
          if(x>=1 and x <=1){
              print("lose")
              count = 0
          }
          count = count + x
        }
</code></pre>
The goal of the repeat construct function is to loop a certain number of times.
Here the player executes all the code inside the repeat 5 times, though 5 could be another
integer greater than 0.

4. Anonymous Functions and more Probability Control Flow
========================================================

Finally, we will show how the program may end in a way that gives the developer
more useful information.


<pre><code>
agent A {
      ~int x = 0
      ~int count = 0
      create(){
          print("On create A")
      }
      action {
        x = roll()
        if((x>=1) and (x <=1)){
            print("lose")
            count = 0
        }
        count = count + x
      }
      destroy {

      }
      none print_hi() {
          print('hi')
          return
      }
      none print_num(~int x) {
          print(x)
          return
      }
      int roll() {
          ~int sdg = ( 2:1 | 4:2 | 6:3 | 10:4 )
          print("die roll")
          print(sdg)
          return sdg
      }
    int getCount(){
    return count 
  }
}

agent B {
      ~int x = 0
      ~int count = 0
      create(){
          print("On create A")
      }
      action {
        repeat(5){
          x = roll()
          if(x>=1 and x <=1){
              print("lose")
              count = 0
          }
          count = count + x
        }
      }
      destroy {

      }
      none print_hi() {
          print('hi')
          return
      }
      none print_num(~int x) {
          print(x)
          return
      }
      int roll() {
          ~int sdg = ( 2:1 | 4:2 | 3:3 | 2:4 )
          return sdg
      }
}


environment {
    ~int apoints = 0
    ~int bpoints = 0
    ~int win = 10
    populate {
        ~A a = A()
        ~B b = B()
    }

    action {
        print("a.x:", a.count)
        print("b.n:", b.count )
        apoints = a.count
        bpoints = b.count
    }
}

terminate {
    (apoints-win>=0) {
        print("done. A reached 10 points")
    }
    (bpoints-win>=0) {
        print("done. B reached 10 points")
    }
}

analysis {
}
</code></pre>

Before we complete our discussion, let us turn our attention to the line

<pre><code>
~int sdg = ( 2:1 | 4:2 | 6:3 | 10:4 )
</code></pre> 

When the environment is populating the board and establishing the
initial configuration, this line ensures some randomness. Essentially this is just like any other
assignment statement except that the right side’s evaluation to true or
false is of a syntax that is unique from that of other languages. The
regular expression for this general form is:

<pre><code>( (<weight\>:<value\> | )\* <weight\>:<value\> | <weight\>:<value\> )</code></pre>

This construct is critical to Mongoose’s focus on baking clear and
concise probability control flow into simulations. The weights here act
as a probability distribution. That is, if one value has weight x and
another value has weight 2\*x, the latter has twice the probability of
being assigned to the variable on the left of the assignment statement.
The weights are thus normalized. All weights must be non-negative
integer values. The values must be of the same type as the type that the
value is assigned to. The entire expression evaluates to one of the
values with the probability associated with that value. In our case each
cell’s alive value has equal chance of being true or false.

In the terminate block we see the use of a function without a declared
name. This is called an anonymous function. It is used most often for
quick and concise code segmentation and more specifically, when the code
within that function is not useful anywhere else.


Due to Mongoose’s focus on coding simulations, its creators included a
construct called pif/pelif/pelse that could be used by programmers in more
advanced programs. See our documentation for specific syntax.
Here is an example:

<pre><code>
pif(0.3) {
			moveRandom(grid[3][4])
}
pelif(0.6) {
			moveRandom(grid[1][2])
}
pelse {
			moveRandom(grid[5][7])
}</code></pre>


This construct makes probability baked into control flow. This
construct is a probability inspired modification on Python’s if, elif,
and else construct with one major difference: Mongoose has probabilities
in the parentheses whereas Python has boolean expressions. In our
example, this means that with probability .3, the code in the curly
braces right after pif will execute. With probability .6, the code in
the code in the curly braces right after pelif will execute. And
finally, with .1 (=1-.6-.3) probability the line right after pelse will
execute. If the pif expression contains a value greater than one, an
error will occur. If the if expression is followed by pelif ’s that and
their combined sum exceeds one, an error will occur.
